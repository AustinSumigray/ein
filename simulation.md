Ein has a simulation mode that allows it to run without being
connected to any robot.  This mode can be used to view data from the
Million Object Challenge and render photographs.  To start Ein in
simulation mode, first change "physical" to "simulated" in the command
line arguments.  This will cause Ein to start with fake sensor data
from Baxter.  It will generate fake camera images and poses so that
various parts of the system will not crash.
