It's a good idea to run exportDoc to creaet a new version of the words
table for the documentation page.

First create a new release branch from develop:
$ git checkout -b release develop

Then run:
./bump-version.sh and choose the new version number.  This program will git commit, tag, and push the release.

Finally run:
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff release

and push. 

Ein is now released. 

The VERSION in develop is always the last version number we branched off of for the new official release. 


Copy the docs directory to the gh-pages branch to update the live website. 

When you go back to develop, make sure you git merge master, to pull down the version numbering changes, and anything you did on the release branch.
