First create a new release branch from develop:
$ git checkout -b release develop

Then run:
./bump-version.sh and choose the new version number.  This program will git commit, tag, and push the release.

Finally run:
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff release

and push. 

Ein is now released. 

The VERSION in develop is always the last version number we branched off of for the new official release.
